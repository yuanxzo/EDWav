# EDWav
Advanced Evaluation of the Diffuseness of the Seismic Wavefield

# Introduction
We uploaded the Maltab version of this method before June 2023. Now I have launched its Python version to meet more demands. 

Compared to the Maltab version, the Python version has reduced many operations related to the waveform itself, but retained the core program for evaluating diffuseness, making its code appear more concise and beautiful. 
In addition, the Python version uses highly efficient algorithms, which are at least 3-20 times faster than the Maltab version (improvements to the Matlab version's algorithm are currently being updated). 

To maintain consistency in the future, we recommend using the Python version.
