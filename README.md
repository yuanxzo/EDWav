# EDWav
Advanced Evaluation of the Diffuseness of the Seismic Wavefield

# Introduction
We uploaded the Maltab version of this method before June 2023. Now I have launched its Python version to meet more demands. 

Compared to the Maltab version, the Python version has reduced many operations related to the waveform itself, but retained the core program for evaluating diffuseness, making its code appear more concise and beautiful. 

In addition, the Python and Matlab versions of v1.1.0 have adopted more efficient algorithms, which are at least 3-20 times faster than previous versions.

Due to the flexibility of the Python language, we can easily call Python libraries on the Matlab platform like using its built-in functions. Therefore, to maintain consistency, we recommend using the **Python version**. In addition, updates to the Matlab version may be paused in the future.
